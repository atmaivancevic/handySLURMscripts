If just running a typical job (no array):
#SBATCH -J KERMIT
#SBATCH -o /fast/users/a1211880/slurmOUT/slurm-%j.out

# this makes the job name KERMIT and output in the form of slurm-3211198.out, etc.



If running a job with slurm arrays:
#SBATCH -J KERMIT
#SBATCH -o /fast/users/a1211880/slurmOUT/slurm-%A_%a.out

# this makes the job name KERMIT, and slurm output of each array element slurm-3211198_0.out, slurm-3211198_1.out, and so on..
